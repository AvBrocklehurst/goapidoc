# Go API Doc

Go API Doc allows you to automatically generate markdown or HTML documentation for your HTTP API from comments on http.Handlers.

This is a package I am working on for fun and out of interest. It may at somepoint be worth using. 

HTML design is heavily influenced by the awesome https://github.com/lord/slate

# TODO: 

- [ ] Document setup and usage process
- [ ] Create list of all th things I want to do and make them into issues to be worked on
- [ ] Parse markdown into beautiful documentation (mabye into slate)
